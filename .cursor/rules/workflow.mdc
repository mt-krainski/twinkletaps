# Agentic Development Rules: File-Based Kanban + Small Reviewable Increments

## Goals

* Mimic a normal software development lifecycle with clear stages: **Plan → Build → Review → Merge**.
* Use a **filesystem Kanban**: each task is a file; board columns are directories.
* Optimize for **small, reviewable, testable increments**:

  * Target **~200-300 lines changed** per task (guideline, not a hard cap).
  * **Invariant: the application must build and run successfully after every task.** A task that leaves the app in a broken state (e.g. DB schema out of sync with ORM, missing imports, broken contracts between layers) is not a valid increment — even if a subsequent task would fix it.
  * Each task must produce a **coherent, verifiable increment** (not "half a feature").

* Make work easy to audit:

  * Every change set links back to a **task ID**.
  * Each task includes verification steps, test plan, and (when applicable) PR/branch metadata.

---

## Kanban Board in the Repository

Create a directory at repo root:

* `./.kanban/`

With these columns (directories):

* `.kanban/10_analysis_plan/`
  Agent-produced plan and proposed tasks, no code changes.
* `.kanban/20_ready/`
  Approved tasks ready to implement (one file per task).
* `.kanban/30_in_progress/`
  A task currently being implemented.
* `.kanban/40_review/`
  Implemented and ready for code review + verification.
* `.kanban/50_merged/`
  Landed in mainline; includes merge/PR reference.

**Invariant:** A task file exists in **exactly one** column at a time.

---

## Task ID and File Naming

Every task has a unique ID:

* Format: `T-###` (e.g., `T-003`)

Task filename:

* `T-###__short_slug.md`
  Example: `T-003__add_ws_auth_middleware.md`

IDs are immutable. If scope changes substantially, create a new task.

---

## Task File Template (Required Fields)

Each task file MUST include the following sections:

1. **Header**

   * `Task ID:`
   * `Title:`
   * `Owner:` (Human / Agent name)
   * `Status:` (mirrors directory column)
   * `Created:` / `Updated:`

2. **Problem / Goal**

   * What user value this delivers.
   * Non-goals (explicitly state what is out of scope).

3. **Acceptance Criteria**

   * Bullet list of observable outcomes.
   * Must include how to verify the feature works.

4. **Repo Context**

   * Files/components likely involved (paths).
   * Existing patterns to follow (frameworks, architectural constraints).
   * Relevant prior code / modules and why.

5. **Implementation Plan (Small & Concrete)**

   * Steps with expected code touchpoints.
   * Expected change size estimate (rough LOC delta).

6. **Test Plan**

   * Unit/integration/e2e updates required.
   * Commands to run (exact).
   * Any fixtures/mocks needed.

7. **Verification Notes**

   * Manual validation steps (if applicable).
   * Screenshots/log snippets expected (optional).

8. **Risk / Rollback**

   * What could break, and how to rollback safely. This is only relevant for changes that actually need a rollback strategy. E.g. database changes. The default rollback strategy is to roll-back the deployment to the previous version. This is only relevant if for some reason that is not possible or dangerous.

9. **Metadata**

   * `Branch:` (if used)
   * `PR:` (link or placeholder)
   * `Depends on:` (Task IDs)
   * `Related:` (Issue/Jira IDs, optional)

## Stage Responsibilities and Rules

### Stage 10: Analysis & Planning (Agent → `10_analysis_plan`)

**Agent must:**

0. Ask clarifying questions if the request is ambiguous before proceeding. Err on the side of asking.
1. **Scan the repo** to understand:

   * Architecture, conventions, test setup, CI, linters, code ownership patterns.

2. Identify:

   * Where changes should live.
   * Existing helpers/utilities to reuse.
   * Risks and unknowns.

3. Produce an **implementation plan**:

   * implementation plan should consist of an overview of work needed to be done - think of this as an explicit list of thigs to do
   * implementation plan breaks the work down into smaller tasks:
      * Each task is a coherent increment (not half a feature).
      * Aim for ~200-300 LOC change per task.
      * Each task must be testable/verifiable in isolation.
      * If one feature is large, split by **vertical slices** (thin end-to-end capability) or by **preparatory refactor** that is independently valuable.
      * After each change, the application must remain functioning. E.g. it's not acceptable to have one task modify the database schema and a second task modify the prisma orm definition of that schema

**Task decomposition rules**

* ✅ Good splits:

  * "Add auth middleware + tests" (complete behavior + verification)
  * "Add DB migration + read API endpoint + tests" (complete path)
  * "Introduce shared utility + refactor two call sites + tests" (coherent cleanup enabling next steps)

* ❌ Bad splits:

  * "Add half of endpoint logic" then "add rest of endpoint logic"
  * "Add UI skeleton" with nothing runnable or testable
  * "Run DB migration to rename tables" then "update ORM schema and app code to match" — the app is broken between these two tasks
  * Any split where task N changes a contract (schema, API, types) and task N+1 updates the consumers — the app must not be broken in between

Dos and don'ts:
- make each task clear and descriptive


**Output artifacts**

* Append the plan to the original task as a new section (Plan)
* Ask human for review
* After human accepts the plan, create separate task files in `.kanban/20_ready/` for each proposed task.
* Tasks should reference the plan document

---

### Stage 20: Ready (Human gate → `20_ready`)

**Human responsibility**

* Select next task(s) to execute.
* Optionally edit acceptance criteria or priorities.

**Agent responsibility**

* Do not start multiple tasks in parallel unless explicitly instructed.
* When starting a task: move exactly one file to `30_in_progress/`.
* Focus on exactly one work item at a time. Feel free to reference Epic for additional context.

---

### Stage 30: Development (Agent → `30_in_progress`)

**Agent must:**

0. Move task to the in-progress directory. Prefer `mv` to recreating the file.
1. Create a branch (if branch workflow used):

   * `task/<TASK_ID>/<slug>`

2. Implement strictly according to the task scope.
3. Keep changes within the targeted review size; if scope expands:

   * Stop and create a follow-up task; do not silently balloon.

4. Update tests and docs necessary for the increment.
5. Run the project's standard checks locally (as available).

**Definition of Done for Development**

* Acceptance criteria satisfied.
* Test plan implemented and runnable.
* No obvious lint/type failures introduced.
* **Application builds and runs successfully** — verify with the project's build command. The app must not be left in a broken state.
* Task file metadata updated:

  * Branch name
  * PR link/placeholder
  * Notes about what changed

**Then**

* Fire up lint and tests for the repo. 
* If everything green - move task file to `40_review/`.

---

### Stage 40: Review & Merge (Human → `40_review` → `50_merged`)

**Agent (when invoked for review) must:**

* Re-read the task requirements and compare with the change.
* Check for:

  * Correctness, edge cases, security/regression risks
  * Consistency with repo patterns
  * Test adequacy (what's missing)
  * Documentation / comments where needed
  * Ensure tests pass (this can also be done by checking CI)

* Provide a concise review report in the task file:

  * "Pass / Needs changes"
  * Specific required edits

**Human responsibility**

* Final sanity check; optionally run smoke tests.

**If changes required**

* Move back to `30_in_progress/` with explicit review notes.

**If accepted**

* Verify all CI is green (if applicable).
* Ensure task file includes PR link, summary of what merged, and verification evidence.
* Merge and move task file to `50_merged/`.
* Optionally append release note or changelog reference if your repo uses it.

---

## Pull Requests and Linking

If using PRs:

* PR title format: `[TASK_ID] <Title>`
* PR description must include:

  * Task ID
  * What changed
  * How to test
  * Risks/rollback notes

Task file must include PR URL once created.

---

## Quality Bar (Non-Negotiables)

* Follow existing architecture and naming conventions.
* Prefer reuse over invention.
* No dead code, commented-out blocks, or "temporary hacks" without explicit task notes.
* Every behavior change must have:

  * Tests OR a clearly documented reason why tests are not feasible, plus manual verification steps.
* Keep diffs reviewable:

  * Avoid large mechanical refactors mixed with feature work unless the task is explicitly a refactor task.

---

## Operating Mode: How You (the Human) Invoke Agents

You will typically do:

1. Invoke **Planner Agent** with a description of the work:

   * Output: plan + tasks created in `20_ready/`.
2. Pick next task and invoke **Builder Agent** on that task file:

   * Output: code + task moved to `40_review/`.
3. Invoke **Reviewer Agent** on the review task file:

   * Output: review notes; pass → merge + `50_merged/`, fail → `30_in_progress`.

---

## Default Assumptions (Override Per Repo)

* Branch naming: `task/<TASK_ID>/<slug>`
* Commit messages: `<TASK_ID>: <short message>`
* Test commands: use the repo's documented defaults; if missing, the agent must infer and document the commands used.
