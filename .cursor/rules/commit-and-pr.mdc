# Commit and open PR

When the user asks to commit and create a pull request (e.g. "commit and open a PR", "push and create PR"):

1. **Stage only the changes that belong to the work**  
   Exclude unrelated files (e.g. `.cursor/rules/*` unless they are part of the change).

2. **Create one informative commit**
   - Example:
   - Message format: `Short title` (ignore the task ID here, it's not relevant), then a short body listing what changed (bullet points or short paragraphs).
     ```
     Update app code — Team → Device

     - Prisma: Team/UserTeam → Device/UserDevice; add deviceUuid, mqttTopic, mqttUsername; remove isPrivate
     - Services: team.ts → device.ts (getWorkspaceDevices, getDevice, getUserDeviceRole); workspace roles → admin|member|guest
     - WorkspaceProvider: DeviceInfo, devices, navigateToDevice, workspaceRole
     - Sidebar: Devices section, Lightbulb; stories updated. Layout and test utils aligned.
     ```

3. **Push the current branch to origin**
   - `git push -u origin <current-branch>`

4. **Open a PR with `gh`**
   - `gh pr create --base <target-branch> --title "<same as commit title>" --body "<body>"`
   - Target branch is usually the one the feature was branched from (e.g. `implement-nextjs-app`, `main`). Ask if unclear.
   - PR body: include Task ID, "What changed" (brief bullets), "How to test", and "Depends on" if relevant.
   - DO NOT add a Cursor attribution

5. **Return the PR URL** to the user (e.g. from `gh pr create` output).
